# Broadsheet

**A reading machine for long-form writing.**

Broadsheet is a single-file, newspaper-inspired viewer for text.  
It treats writing as something *set*, not scrolled—  
printed in columns, held by rules, given place, date, and mood.

This is not an app.  
It is a **desk tool**.

## Why

Modern writing is consumed inside feeds, panes, and endless scrolls.  
Broadsheet restores the feeling of a page that belongs somewhere.

It exists to:
- slow the reader down  
- give writing weight and locality  
- separate signal from interface noise  
- let words *sit* instead of perform  

---

## Characteristics

- One `index.html` file  
- No framework  
- No build step  
- Newspaper column layout  
- Slab-serif headlines, serif body text  
- Optional paper grain and ink bleed  
- Local “cuttings” drawer for saved excerpts  

Everything visible.  
Nothing hidden.

## Use

Open `index.html` in a modern browser.  
Paste writing.  
Read slowly.

Selections may be saved as *cuttings*—  
small excerpts kept locally, like scraps folded into a coat pocket.

## Context

Broadsheet is part of **Haven Artifacts**.

Artifacts are tools:
desks, lenses, presses, rooms.

They are not products.  
They do not ask for attention.  
They wait.

If this object earns permanence, it may later move into Haven proper.  
Until then, it remains free.
