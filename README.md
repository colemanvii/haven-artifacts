# haven-artifacts

This repository holds small, finished pieces from the Haven system.

Not demos. Not experiments.  
Artifacts.

Each item exists because it needed to exist—not to persuade, perform, or scale.

Haven is about orientation over expression.  
Signal over spectacle.  
Clarity earned through restraint.

Ars longa, vita brevis.
