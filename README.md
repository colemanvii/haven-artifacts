Haven Artifacts

Tools of orientation.

This repository contains small, intentional tools—artifacts—that support clear thinking, slow reading, and aligned living.

These are not products.
They are desks, lenses, presses, and rooms.

Structure

reading-machines/
Interfaces for reading and writing that privilege clarity over speed.

broadsheet/
A newspaper-inspired viewer for long-form writing.

Artifacts may evolve, fork, or remain unfinished.
If one earns permanence, it may later move into Haven proper.

Until then, they remain free.
